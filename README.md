Scripts for BMA paper
This repository has the scripts to generate data for paper titiled "Implementing the Blowers–Masel Approximation to Scale Activation Energy Based on Reaction Enthalpy in Mean-Field Microkinetic Modeling for Catalytic Methane Partial Oxidation", `base_original` has the scripts for 81 hypothetical metals
on models with Arrhenius rates, `base_bm` has the scripts for 81 hypothetical on models with Blowers-Masel rates.

To run the scripts, please follow the instruction on [RMG website](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py) to build a conda environment.

Please contact Chao Xu, xu.chao@northeastern.edu for any questions.

If you found the scripts in this repo useful, please consider citing
